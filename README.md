## Fooocus Prompt Extends

This is a fooocus prompt extends extension.

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
pnpm dev
# or
npm run dev
```

Open your browser and load the appropriate development build. For example, if you are developing for the chrome browser, using manifest v3, use: `build/chrome-mv3-dev`.


## Making production build

```

This should create a production bundle for your extension, ready to be zipped and published to the stores.
